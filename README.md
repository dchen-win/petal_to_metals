## üìÑ Overview  
This project classifies flowers into 104 categories using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We deployed models on Intel‚Äôs Developer Cloud (CPU), Kaggle (TPU), and local machines. The dataset, provided in binary TFRecord format, includes labeled and unlabeled flower images. We used TensorFlow with Keras to build and evaluate image classification models.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Build accurate image classifier using ResNet50/ResNet50V2  
- Compare performance across CPU vs. TPU platforms  
- Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualize classification results and confusion matrix

## üßæ Dataset Description  
- **Training:** 12,753 labeled images (192√ó192 and 512√ó512)  
- **Validation:** 3,712 labeled images  
- **Test:** 7,382 unlabeled images  
- **Format:** Binary TFRecord (image + label)

## üîç Methodology  

### 1. Data Pipeline & Preprocessing  
- Dynamic distribution strategy for TPU/CPU  
- Image scaling and data augmentation  

### 2. Model Architecture & Training  
- Models: ResNet50 and ResNet50V2 (pretrained on ImageNet)  
- Epochs: 90 | Batch Size: 128 (Kaggle), 16√ó8 (DevCloud)  
- Callbacks: `EarlyStopping`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, `LearningRateScheduler`  

### 3. Evaluation Metrics  
- **Intel DevCloud (CPU, ResNet50V2):**  
  - Precision: 0.872 | Recall: 0.836 | F1-score: 0.848  
- **Kaggle (TPU, ResNet50):**  
  - Precision: 0.933 | Recall: 0.931 | F1-score: 0.929  
- **Local (CPU):**  
  - Limited to small images (192x192), slow runtime (~13 min/epoch)

## üìä Visualizations  
- Batch image predictions (visual validation)  
- Accuracy and loss plots by epoch  
- Confusion matrix heatmaps

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Platforms  
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Compute Platforms:** Intel DevCloud (CPU), Kaggle (TPU), Local (CPU)  
- **Callbacks Used:**  
  - `ReduceLROnPlateau`  
  - `EarlyStopping`  
  - `LearningRateScheduler`
